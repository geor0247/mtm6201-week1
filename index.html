        <p>I'm an aspiring UX/UI designer, currently studying as an Interactive Media Design student at Algonquin College. I was raised in Kuwait, but I am an Indian citizen. I'm passionate about creating designs that make people's lives easier, and I believe in the power of technology to do so. I always look for ways to challenge myself and find new opportunities to grow.</p>
        <p>Doing what I love and loving what I do is my motto and it has helped me be the best version of myself. Confidence, being smart, attention to small details and compassion are values I hold the closest.</p><br>
